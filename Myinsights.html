However, during the process, I learned a lot and became skilled in each of these distinct methods of communication through blood, sweat, and tears. Despite how difficult and time-consuming it was, I believe this subject was really valuable to me as a student.</p>
                   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
                   	<p>Creating websites, in comparison to film, sound, or photography, is an entirely new kind of communication for me. Websites serve as both a means of communication and a container for other forms of communication. As a result, designing Websites is a complex undertaking since you must consider what your webpage is communicating as well as if it is complementing other types of communication presented on it.</p>
                   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
                   	<p>Not to mention that learning and using HTML and CSS is challenging. Learning even the fundamentals of the coding was difficult for me as a beginner because it was unlike anything I had ever done before. However, I gradually gained a grasp of them through research and debugging, but there is still much more I could learn. In fact, using and learning HTML and CSS has given me the utmost respect for web designers and any job that deals with computers or the Internet. As a result, beautifully designed and user-friendly websites are no longer taken for granted. This course has taught me not just about communication, but also about how tough it is to deal with computers and the Internet.</p>
                   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
                   	<p>In summary, I learned a lot while creating this website. I learned to code, despite the fact that it was difficult at first. My experience with generating this has been difficult because I have no idea how to do it, even when it comes to inputting photos. But through research and troubleshooting, I slowly grew to have an understanding of them, but still leaving a room for improvement. And although this activity became very challenging to me, I'm thrilled and enjoy doing it. :)</p>
